 * Class: COMP-10184 â€“ Mohawk College
 * Title: PIR Sensor Test Application
 * 
 * Description: This application is meant to resemble a simple alarm 
 * system using a PIR sensor. This alarm uses a countdown and if it 
 * reaches 0 the alrm will activate. If a button is pressed before 
 * the countdown reaches 0 the alarm will disable. If the button is 
 * pressed a second time the alarm will be re-enabled where thw PIR 
 * sensor will look for motion to begin the countdown again.
